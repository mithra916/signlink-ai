## SignLink – Bridging Communication Through AI
```SignLink is an intelligent communication system that empowers individuals from the deaf and mute community by breaking traditional language barriers. This AI-powered web application seamlessly converts sign language gestures into readable text, enables speech-to-text conversion, and supports text-to-speech output, fostering inclusive digital interaction.```

Key Highlights
  Sign Language Recognition
Detects and translates hand gestures into text using computer vision and gesture classification.

 Speech-to-Text
Converts spoken input to real-time text, assisting hearing-impaired users in understanding verbal communication.

  Text-to-Speech
Offers synthesized voice output for the mute community to vocalize typed or converted text.

  Web-Based Interface
Lightweight and intuitive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for ease of use across devices.

  Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Backend: Python, Flask

AI/ML: OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow ,YOLOv8 

APIs: Text-to-Speech (TTS), Speech Recognition

Version Control: Git & GitHub

  How It Works
Sign Language Input – Captures hand gestures via webcam and classifies them using trained models.

Speech Input – Records voice and transcribes it into text using speech recognition APIs.

Text Output & Vocalization – Displays or speaks the translated content based on user needs.

   Future Enhancements
Multi-language and regional sign support

Integration with smart devices (IoT)

Slide navigation via gestures for presentations

Emotion detection and context-aware responses

   Purpose
SignLink is built with the vision of creating a more inclusive, accessible, and empowering digital environment for the hearing and speech-impaired communities. It serves not just as a tool, but as a step toward universal accessibility in everyday communication.
